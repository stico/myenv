# from 13.04, ubuntu use xkb instead of xmodmap, so following line not work (but also seems no harm)
# from 14.04, could make xmodmap run on login as Startup App, BUT restores after suspend/hibernate
xmodmap ~/.xmodmaprc

# seems the platform check NOT work, this makes x11 failed to start on osx
#uname | grep -i -q Linux && xmodmap ~/.xmodmaprc
